# OpenAI API provider

TokenBar's OpenAI API provider targets the API Platform organization dashboard, not ChatGPT/Codex subscription limits.

## Data sources

1. Preferred: `OPENAI_ADMIN_KEY` or configured key with Admin API access.
   - `GET https://api.openai.com/v1/organization/costs`
   - `GET https://api.openai.com/v1/organization/usage/completions`
   - Daily buckets use `bucket_width=1d`, costs are grouped by `line_item`, and completion usage is grouped by `model`.
2. Fallback: legacy `GET https://api.openai.com/v1/dashboard/billing/credit_grants` for normal API keys that cannot access organization usage.

## Setup

Store a key in the shared app/CLI config:

```bash
printf '%s' "$OPENAI_ADMIN_KEY" | tokenbar config set-api-key --provider openai --stdin
```

Settings → Providers → OpenAI writes the same `~/.tokenbar/config.json` field. `OPENAI_ADMIN_KEY` is preferred over
`OPENAI_API_KEY` because it unlocks organization costs and usage; a normal API key only supports the legacy balance
fallback.

## Menu display

- Admin API data renders inline Today/7d/configured-window KPIs plus a compact spend chart.
- The inline usage card opens a hosted chart submenu with daily spend, token, and request trends plus selected-day detail.
- Top model and top spend labels come from the configured completion/cost buckets when the Admin API returns them.
- Legacy balance data keeps the older available/used credit summary and does not show organization graphs.

## Notes

- Costs are the source of truth for financial totals. Token usage and cost buckets can differ slightly from dashboard billing reconciliation.
- Admin API keys are organization-scoped and cannot be used for normal model inference.
